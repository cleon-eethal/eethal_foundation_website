Discover beloved stories brought to life by our talented student translators. Each story is available in both Tamil and English, making reading accessible and engaging for bilingual learners.

These translations are created by middle and high school students participating in our Young Translators program, developing language skills while sharing timeless literature with the community. Some of the advanced stories (such as translating Tamil classics to English) are translated by adult volunteers.

Please review the volunteer expectations and policies below.

## Student Volunteer Expectations

1. Be Punctual. Keep the Adult Volunteer informed of your absence or delay in attending before the start of the class.
2. Be willing to learn and accept guidance from the Adult Volunteer.
3. Respect adult volunteers and peer volunteers.
4. Inappropriate language or behavior during class sessions will not be tolerated.
5. Be reliable, trustworthy and responsible.

## Volunteer Hour Policies

<div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 my-4 rounded-r-lg">
  <p class="text-blue-700"><em>Note: This is a guideline only. Adult volunteers reserve the right to assign volunteer hours based on complexity and contribution.</em></p>
</div>

Students are credited volunteer hours based on the hours they have contributed. When crediting hours, round it to the nearest 1/4 hour.

Rounding should be used if the time in/out does not fall on the quarter hour as well. Time worked of 7 minutes or less should be rounded back and time worked of 8 minutes or more should be rounded forward to the next quarter hour.

| Minutes Worked | Reported Minutes |
|---|---|
| 0-7 | 0 |
| 8-22 | 15 |
| 23-37 | 30 |
| 38-52 | 45 |
| 53-60 | 60 |

*Note: Please enter the volunteer hours in minutes only. Please do not use decimals or fractions.*

### What if a student joined the session but produced little or no output?

If the student attends the online session but fails to produce any output then the student cannot be credited volunteer hours. If the student produces very little output then the following metric shall be used:

**Time in minutes = total word count of the translated text / 5**

On average, a student can translate 200-300 words per hour (3-5 words per minute) depending on the complexity of the language. For example, a student has translated 50 words which have been reviewed by the adult volunteer. Then volunteer hours shall be calculated as 50/5 = 10 mins.

| Translated and reviewed word count | Minutes awarded |
|---|---|
| 0-50 | 10 |
| 51-100 | 20 |
| 101-150 | 30 |
| 151-200 | 40 |
| 201-250 | 50 |
| 251-300 | 60 |

<div class="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 p-4 my-4 rounded-r-lg">
  <p class="text-yellow-800 font-bold">NOTE: Google translated words as such may not be taken into consideration for word count. Student work should demonstrate their effort in improving the machine translation version.</p>
</div>

### Can students work offline?

We do not encourage offline work in general. Students are expected to attend the online classes every week and work with the adult volunteer and peers in a collaborative effort. However, an adult volunteer can use their discretion to allow offline work on a case by case basis or for reasons such as illness, emergency or exams.

An Adult volunteer's discretion for offline work will be based on a student's knowledge, fluency and ability to work independently. The volunteer hours awarded for offline work will be based on the same metric mentioned above.

## Youth Lead Expectations and Policies

At EETHAL Foundation we are committed to empowering youth by providing them with opportunities to develop and exercise their leadership capabilities. One of such opportunities is the "Youth Lead" role.

### Roles and Responsibilities of a Youth Lead

Responsibilities include (in addition to their regular work):

- Helping students to publish the adult volunteer approved translated stories
- Making sure the students have corrected their mistakes in the translated stories
- Taking attendance as directed by the Adult volunteer

Youth Leads will be recognized for their role in the volunteer certificates as well as in the team page in the EETHAL Foundation website.

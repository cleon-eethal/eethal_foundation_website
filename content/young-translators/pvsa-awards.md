## What is the PVSA award?

In 2003, the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation founded the President's Volunteer Service Award to recognize the important role of volunteers in America's strength and national identity. This award honors individuals whose service positively impacts communities in every corner of the nation and inspires those around them to take action, too.

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-yellow-700 space-y-2">
    <li>Supervisor must be a representative of a verified nonprofit, organization, or school. Students cannot list a parent's, sibling's, friend's (or their own!) name and email as the primary contact. The contact's email should match the organization.</li>
    <li>Listing accurate and valid contact information is the best way to get service hours approved. Otherwise, students risk not having volunteer hours approved.</li>
    <li>We will review ALL service hour entries and maintain the right to contact beneficiary organizations to verify volunteer work completed. EETHAL Foundation has final discretion on volunteer eligibility and may reject any entries that are incorrectly documented or unsubstantiated.</li>

## Frequently Asked Questions

**1. Can volunteers submit hours earned from service activities outside of EETHAL Foundation?**

Yes. Hours counted towards the PVSA do NOT need to be uniquely earned for this award. Service hours contributed through, or as part of, school clubs, Boy/Girl Scouts, or similar civic or community initiatives may be applied towards PVSA recognition, at the discretion of EETHAL Foundation. However we require that:

- Students should be an active participant in EETHAL Foundation
- At least 30 of the total hours submitted are earned through EETHAL Foundation
- All volunteer hours submitted for PVSA approval must be within the past 12-month period at the time of application by EETHAL Foundation

**2. Do volunteers have to pay for their award package?**

No, there is no cost for the PVSA award package.

**3. What if I had a birthday that increased my hourly requirement?**

Age category is determined by the age a volunteer is for at least 7 months out of a designated 12-month award period.

**4. Can I apply for a PVSA each year?**

Yes, volunteers can apply for one award each 12-month period. Example: A student applied for the PVSA on August 25, 2025. She or He may apply again after August 26, 2026.

**5. When will the PVSA applications be accepted?**

We accept PVSA applications twice a year - November and August of each year. Applications must be submitted by November 15th and August 15th. Preference will be given to high school students applying for college in the month of August. Once the application process is completed and the hours are submitted to the PVSA, the timeframe that the PVSA approves the awards varies and is out of the control of EETHAL Foundation. We will contact you once we receive the awards to decide on a presentation/delivery time.

**6. When can I expect to receive the award?**

The award certification process varies depending on the number of applicants each quarter. Sometimes the PVSA office has had a backorder of awards and the actual award may not be ordered for several months. Unfortunately, this matter is out of our control. Best case scenario, once EETHAL Foundation verifies all volunteer hours and submits the information to the PVSA, the awards take 2-4 weeks to arrive.

**7. What if I'm a volunteer but I am not yet a United States citizen?**

Per federal program rules, only U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents (i.e., green card holders) may be awarded the PVSA.

## Benefits of the President's Volunteer Service Award

Earning a President's Volunteer Service Award may seem like a big goal and something hard to achieve with school, sports, and other activities. But if you find a cause you love or an organization that inspires you to make a difference, the hours will fly by. Involving your friends in something that inspires you is an opportunity to mix it up and make new memories. It shows dedication over time, which is a great character strength. You'll also discover that when you help others, you can go far in life by learning, growing, and getting recognition from colleges and future employers who appreciate your heart and giving spirit.

## Tips for Students & Parents

- Plan ahead. Earning volunteering hours takes time and consistency.
- Find multiple volunteering opportunities.
- Record all service hours as they are completed.

### What are the main benefits for me for engaging in this activity?

There are many benefits to joining the Young Translators program:

- **Earn volunteer hours** that are often required by your school
- **Apply your skills for community benefit**, particularly supporting educational initiatives in India
- **Build a competitive college application** — colleges and universities value demonstrated community service beyond academics alone
- **Strengthen your heritage language fluency** through practical application. Since language is a primary cultural connection, developing your Tamil proficiency helps you maintain ties to your ancestral roots and identity

### How much Tamil do I need to know?

We require basic skills in reading and writing in Tamil. Students who have attended Tamil educational institutions like the International Tamil Academy, or completed final years at such schools, should be able to manage translations comfortably.

Our sessions involve small groups of a maximum of 5 students paired with one to two adult mentors, providing substantial hands-on guidance throughout the online meetings.

### I am already very busy, how much time commitment does this need?

The program requires only **one hour per week**. Since all translation sessions occur online through video conferencing, there is no commute — saving time for both students and parents.

The schedule follows a quarterly system spanning approximately three months per term. You may enroll during any quarter that matches your availability, with optional opportunities for additional volunteering.

### Is there homework or grading involved with the sessions? Is this a competition?

No! There is no grading and no competitive elements. The program combines learning with volunteering in a supportive environment. Students are not compared or subjected to academic pressure — instead you will experience a welcoming atmosphere where individual strengths contribute to mutual learning and community service.

### Will I get an official proof of time spent on this activity?

Yes. We maintain comprehensive databases tracking volunteer minutes per student. Participation certificates are distributed annually, providing official documentation acceptable to schools, colleges, and employers.

### Are there other benefits to joining this program?

- **Presidential Volunteer Service Awards (PVSA):** Students who accumulate sufficient annual volunteer hours qualify for a presidential medal and an official presidential recognition letter through our partnership with Vetrivel Foundation
- **Community:** You will join a community of similarly motivated individuals, fostering potential friendships and local engagement
- **Inspiration:** We host international speakers who share their perspectives, providing inspiration and learning opportunities
- **Leadership:** Experienced volunteers receive encouragement to assume leadership roles mentoring newcomers

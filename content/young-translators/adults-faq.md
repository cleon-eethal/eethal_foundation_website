### What are the requirements as an adult volunteer in this program? Do I need Tamil teaching experience?

No Tamil teaching experience is necessary. A strong interest in Tamil and passion for involving in community activities is lot more important. Volunteers with various language skill levels have found the work productive and rewarding.

### What are some of the opportunities for adults to participate in this effort?

Adults of all ages and varying Tamil proficiency are welcome. Participation options include:

1. Assisting teen volunteers during weekly online translation sessions
2. Reviewing and improving translated content from student volunteers
3. Training other adult and teen volunteers; providing technical/workflow support
4. Finding speakers for student enrichment webinars and organizing social activities
5. Promoting the program through word-of-mouth and social media

### How much time commitment should I expect to give?

Most volunteers spend about **one hour per week**. For those leading translation sessions, the schedule is predetermined based on availability and team composition. Weekend sessions are preferred to avoid conflicts with school and work. Other volunteers have flexible scheduling, with a request to provide feedback sometime soon after the weekly sessions are over.

### Can I be a volunteer at my own child's team?

Yes, this arrangement is common and beneficial. Parents and students learn together, with children often teaching parents technology skills.

### What if I get too busy on some weeks?

Backup volunteers are available to cover absences. Multiple adult volunteers are assigned to each team to share responsibilities and provide coverage.

### Do I need to be proficient in computers and other tools?

Training is provided for all required software. Google Meet and Google Docs are used — accessible through standard browsers. Basic equipment suffices: any standard laptop or desktop and any OS (Windows, Mac or Chromebook) is fine. Internet connectivity with webcam and microphone is necessary for session facilitators.

### Do I need special software to type in Tamil?

No special software is required. Modern browsers and operating systems have built-in Tamil typing options, with documentation available for installation if needed.

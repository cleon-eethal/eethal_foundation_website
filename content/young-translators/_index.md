# Young Translators Program

Our flagship program connects Tamil-American youth ages 8-18 with their heritage while serving the Tamil-speaking community through translation services.

## Why It Matters

- **Preserves Tamil language and culture** for future generations
- **Develops leadership skills** through community service
- **Earns Presidential Volunteer Service Awards** (PVSA)
- **Builds community connections** between generations

## How It Works

Students meet regularly to:
1. Learn translation skills
2. Work on community translation projects
3. Develop cultural knowledge
4. Earn service hours toward PVSA
